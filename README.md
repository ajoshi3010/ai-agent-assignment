To install dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file, you can use the `pip` command as follows:

1. **Activate Your Virtual Environment (if using one):**
   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies from `requirements.txt`:**
   Run the following command in your project directory (where `requirements.txt` is located):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This command reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs all listed packages with their specified versions.
